# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make all UI elements fully transparent to show the wallpaper behind everything, add file upload for wallpapers, and implement functional ambient sound playback.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove all background colors, backdrop effects, and opacity overlays from every UI component (timer, buttons, controls, dashboard, study goals, statistics, quotes, navigation, settings) so the wallpaper is fully visible
- Add a file upload button to the wallpaper section that allows users to select and upload image files directly from their device
- Implement functional audio playback for all six ambient sounds (rain, coffee shop, forest, waves, white noise, lofi beats) with working play/pause controls and volume slider

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see the wallpaper clearly behind all UI elements with floating text and controls, can upload wallpaper images directly from their device using a file picker, and can play ambient sounds during study sessions with adjustable volume.
