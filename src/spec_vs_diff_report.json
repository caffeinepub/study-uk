  "summary": "The implementation addresses all three requirements but with significant deviations from the specification. While transparent backgrounds have been added to most components (REQ-24), numerous instances still use semi-transparent backgrounds with backdrop blur instead of complete transparency. File upload functionality has been implemented (REQ-25), and ambient sound player has been added (REQ-26), though audio source integration details cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff.",

      "reason": "Many components still use semi-transparent backgrounds (bg-white/10, bg-white/20, bg-black/50) and backdrop-blur effects instead of complete transparency. Examples include navigation bar, buttons, cards, dialogs, sheets, and timer components.",
