# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix ambient sound playback functionality and improve timer page layout spacing.

**Planned changes:**
- Debug and fix the ambient sound player hook so all sounds (rain, coffee shop, forest, waves, white noise, lofi beats) successfully play audio
- Move the timer display down slightly on the page while keeping it horizontally centered
- Add sufficient vertical spacing between the motivational quote and timer display to prevent overlap

**User-visible outcome:** Users can successfully play any ambient sound from the sound library, and the timer page displays with better visual separation between the quote and timer elements.
